# SA Hyperlink Crawler

This document outlines:
- the problem to be solved in my own understanding
- the technical specification of the design of this plugin and how it works
- how this plugin achieves the desired outcome per the user story
- the planned structure for the plugin

## What exactly is the problem?
First, I can understand that website owners always want to improve their website homepage. And the main factor to know  the best way to improve is by understanding wha users see when on the website's homepage. The issue with this is the website owner does not have visibility into which links users actually see when the homepage loads.

So the goal is to create a plugin that:
- Tracks which hyperlinks are visible in the portion of the homepgae that a user sees immediately upon loading (without scrolling down).
- Record this data, including the screen size, for each visit.
- Cleanup the data so it only has the record of the last 7 days ( i.e consistently remove data older than 7 days)
- Let the site owner be able to view this data
